### Standard Grid Visualization

###### Class prefix	.col-md-* .col-lg-*
Bootstrapâ€™s grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content.
The grid system has four class prefixes: -xs (phones), -sm (tablets), -md (desktops), and -lg (larger desktops). The classes can be combined to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.
Each class scales up, so if you wish to set the same widths for xs and sm, you only need to specify xs.
